# FormEmailer
This is a fork of Henrique Abreu's FormEmailer for Google Forms / Sheets. Henrique's script has been updated to a Scripts Add-on, which can be installed in Google Sheets. His original project can be found here:
https://sites.google.com/site/formemailer/form-emailer

This script integrates directly with a Google Sheet that holds Google Form responses. Once installed on the spreadsheet containing form responses, this add-on will automatically send notification emails containing the form responses. There are several configuration values to help you customize the emails, which are detailed below

## Getting Started
If you have not already, please install this add-on on the sheet you would like the program to run on. Download can be found here:
TODO INSERT LINK

### Script Installation
Once you have downloaded the add-on, you should see a new menu at the top of your spreadsheet called "FormEmailer". If you select this menu, click the "Install" button on the drop down that appears.

Select your language and the sheet you would like FormEmailer to send emails about (usually the sheet containing your Google Form responses). Once you select the "Install" button, the add-on will setup it's configuration and create a new sheet called "FormEmailer". This sheet contains all the configuration for the add-on; please do not modify it directly.

### Time-Trigger Installation
In order for FormEmailer to work properly, you must setup a "Time-trigger" to have this add-on run automatically in the background. Below are the steps to get this setup:

1. Open your spreadsheet, and select "Tools > Script Editor" on the top menu. This should open a new tab titled "FormEmailer"
2. On this tab, select "Edit > Current Project Triggers" on the top menu. This will also open a new tab.
3. In this tab, click the "Add Trigger" button found at the bottom right. 
4. A dialog will popup asking for a bunch of configuration values. You can use the values found below as defaults:
   TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT OF CONFIG 
   Note that you can change the "Select type of time based trigger" to have this add-on run autmoatically at any given time interval.

5. Select "Save" on the popup window
6. If eveything went OK, you should see the following row displayed:
   TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT OF SAVED CONFIG
   
7. You can now close the two tabs that were opened, and refresh your spreadsheet.
   
## Configuration
Once you have downloaded, installed and setup the time-trigger, you can now begin to configure FormEmailer. On your spreadsheet, in the top menu, select "FormEmailer > Settings". A detailed explanation for each field is listed below.

### Email Tab

  1. Sender Name - This is the display name that will appear when emails are sent out
  2. Reply To - This is the default 'reply-to' field if you hit "Reply" on FormEmailer emails
  3. To - Email to send FormEmailer emails to
  4. Cc - CC recipient(s) on FormEmailer emails
  5. Bcc - BCC recipient(s) on FormEmailer emails
  6. Subject - Subject line on FormEmailer emails
  7. HTML - Checkbox to determine whether your email "Body" contains HTML
  8. Body - Email body to be sent in FormEmailer emails. If "html" config option is set, this can contain HTML that will render prior to emails being sent out. You will also notice default values here: please refer to the "Formatting" section for more information 
  
### Advanced Tab
  
  1. Form Sheet - The sheet containing your Google Form responses. FormEmailer will generate emails from this sheet
  2. Qtt Emails - The number of emails you want sent out. Multiple email templates are supported (Note: To add another email template, change the number in this field, and select "Save and Close". When you open FormEmailer settings again, you will see your new email tab.
  3. Quota Warning - Emails sent by FormEmailer are restricted by Google's email quota limit (by default, this is 1500 a day). Quota warning will send a warning email out once this number of emails have been sent out by FormEmailer in a day.
  4. Quota Limit - When your daily email quota hits this number, stop sending emails for the day.
  5. Formulas Location - Please see the "Formulas Location" section
  6. Closure mode - Please see the "Formulas Location" section
  7. Remaining Quota - The quota remaining on your daily limit (1500). This is a readonly field, for informational purposes only
  
## Formatting
FormEmailer has several handy formatting tools built in. Below are common use cases

### Variables in Email Template
After intial installation, you may have notcied that the "Body" under the Email tab in Settings contains HTML and variables surrounded by "#"'s. When emails are generated, any text surrounded by #'s will be replaced by the field in the corresponding cell. For example, if your sheet containing form responses has two response fields ("Name" and "Age"), your email template should contain "#Name#" and "#Age#" anywhere you want to insert this value into the email

### Text Formatting

| ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| sUpper | sU | transform all text to uppercase | "Name" > "NAME" |
| sDown | sD | transform all text to lowercase | "Name" > "name" |
| sProper | sP | all first letters will be uppercase and other others lowercase | "mY NAmE" > "My Name" |
